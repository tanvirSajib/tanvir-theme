# Quick-Start Guide

### Activating your first theme

- One of the best ways to understand how to build themes is to look at and study existing themes. 
- Even in advanced development circles, one of the cornerstones of sound development is to reuse code. This is because developers understand that this is the most efficient way to get things done, and many try to abide by the “don’t reinvent the wheel” mantra.

- Regardless of whether you are a developer, this is sound advice. You don’t need to build everything from scratch. There’s a good chance that most of what you want to do has already been created by someone else.
