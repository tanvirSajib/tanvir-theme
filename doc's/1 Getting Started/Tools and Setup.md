### WordPress.org Theme Review Guidelines

It is a good idea to stay up to date with the theme guidelines provided by the WordPress.org Themes Team. These guidelines are required if you plan to submit your theme to the official Theme Directory, but they are also good principles for anyone creating a theme.

You should also follow the WordPress Coding Standards when writing any code for your theme. This will help make sure what you are creating meets some minimum quality standards.
